* :open_file_folder: **src**: folder containing materials for the hcpinnseikonal package.

## Notebooks
The following notebooks are provided:

- :orange_book: ``X1.ipynb``: notebook performing ...;
- :orange_book: ``X2.ipynb``: notebook performing ...


## Getting started :space_invader: :robot:
To ensure reproducibility of the results, we suggest using the `environment.yml` file when creating an environment.

Simply run:
```
./install_env.sh
```
It will take some time, if at the end you see the word `Done!` on your terminal you are ready to go. 

Remember to always activate the environment by typing:
```
conda activate my_env
```

**Disclaimer:** All experiments have been carried on a Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6230R CPU @ 2.10GHz equipped with a single NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 GPU. Different environment 
configurations may be required for different combinations of workstation and GPU.
